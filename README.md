Hi there! My name is Leeroy Mubaiwa, and I'm a systems developer at the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE). I work on developing and maintaining the systems that power the ZSE's trading platform, ensuring that it runs smoothly and efficiently.

## About Me

I have always been passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I pursued a degree in Computer Science to further my knowledge and skills, and I am grateful to have landed a job at the ZSE where I can put my skills to use in a meaningful way.

## Fun Facts

- In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and watching NBA games.
- I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I've seen all the movies multiple times.
- I love trying out new recipes in the kitchen, and I'm particularly fond of spicy food.
- I'm also an avid traveler and I've visited several countries around the world, including Thailand, South Africa, and the United States.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me! Feel free to [connect with me](mailto:lmubaiwa@zse.co.zw) if you have any questions or just want to say hi.
